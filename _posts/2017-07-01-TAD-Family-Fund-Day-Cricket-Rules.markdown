# TAD Family Fun Day Cricket Rules

### Game Rules

 - To encourage everyone to play cricket especially bat & bowl without compromising the seriousness of the game. Depending on availabilities people are divided into 4 teams and we will have either six a side/seven a side/8 a side playing super 6s/super 7s or super 8s cricket tournament.
 - Depending on numbers you will play either a 6over game/7over game/8over game. Wicket keeper provided by any other two teams that are not playing.
 - Every team member will have to bowl 1 over and a pair has to bat only two overs. Throw bowling is allowed :) (not for the finals)
 - If you get out you still will bat but your team loses 10 runs. So that said every team starts with a score of 100. Non striker will get the strike if a batsman gets out in any form like runout, stump etc.
 - Singles, doubles etc. as normal but a Straight six or a Straight 4 will give you double runs (just to make the game bit more exciting). Wides, Noballs will cost the team 2 runs for each extra. No free hits sorry, already is a decent penalty for extras and also it has to be fair competition between bat and bowl.


###Â Tournament format

 - Match 1	Team 1 Vs Team 4
 - Match 2	Team 2 Vs Team 3
 - Match 3	4 over a side game Match 1 Losers Vs Match 2 Losers (Just an extra match to make everyone happy. Also this is an important match as good players from this game might play final)
 - Final                Match 1 Winner Vs Match 2 Winner (This will be a 12 over  game with normal cricket rules and both winning teams have a choice to pick players from losing teams to make strong teams into the final)

### Notes

-  Teams not playing a match should volunteer to do umpiring and wicket keeping; the other two team captains who are playing will pick who they want. The rest should volunteer children activities please
- Umpires decision is final and NO QUESTIONS ASKED WHATSOEVER.
- No LBW but to make things simple all extras are counted including bye and leg byes.
